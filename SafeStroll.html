    <h1>Getting students home safe.</h1>

    <p style="padding: 30px; line-height: 1.6">
      Do you ever find it uncomfortable to walk around campus at night? <br />
      Do you ever wish you had someone to walk home with? <br />
      Have you wished that there was an alternative to Tufts SafeRide, where
      university police drive students home? <br />
      Would you want to ensure that your peers feel safe? <br />
      <br />
      SafeStroll is a non-profit organization aiming to ensure that students on
      college campuses get home safe. The program we offer involves a group of
      student volunteers as well as a mobile app that matches pairs of
      volunteers to a student looking for someone to walk with. One of our goals
      is to promote a safe community on campus, and SafeStroll facilitates the
      development of trust among the student body by uniting users and
      volunteers.
